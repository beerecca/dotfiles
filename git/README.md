Git
===

This folder includes a `.gitconfig` and `.gitignore` that, once stowed, will be global and apply to all projects. Your global gitignore should contain ignores that are specific to your environment and might not be considered in a project's gitignore. The gitignore included here was compiled from github's global gitignore templates which can be found here: <https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master/Global>
