TMUX

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach tem and reattach them to a different terminal. See the [tmux cheatsheet](https://github.com/usabilla/smileyfiles/blob/master/_cheatsheets/tmux.md) for a quick reference to the basic commands and shortcuts.
