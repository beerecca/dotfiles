## Bash

Bash or the Bourne-Again SHell, is a shell for your terminal, and is the default on most systems. It is a superset implementation of sh (Shell Command Language specification). On most systems, `/bin/sh` points to `/bin/bash`.

Zsh (or Z Shell) is another popular terminal shell, that has a number of more powerful features and configuration than bash, such as better autocompletion, prompts and shared histories. It is therefore less portable and less backwards compatible than bash.
