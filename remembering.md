## Things I'm Trying to Remember to Use

### Terminal Navigation

- `ctrl + r` - press again to cycle through your search
- Move in terminal with CMD -> and ALT -> and ALT DELETE as you would in your editor! https://coderwall.com/p/dapstw/keybindings-for-macosx-users-on-iterm2

### Folder Navigation

Can trust these commands will confirm/help you when you use them!

- ls
- rm
- cp
- mv
- mkdir
- tree
- cdls

### New Laptop

Remember to also copy your iTerm and Raycast settings (in Google Drive), and activate VSCode Settings Sync.
